1. Introduction

Efficient transportation systems are critical for economic growth and social development. A key capability for intelligent transportation management is accurate short-term forecasting of traffic variables like volume and speed. Timely and reliable traffic flow prediction enables optimal coordination of infrastructure and assets to reduce congestion, energy use, and environmental impact [1]. 

With the widespread deployment of sensors and emergence of new data sources like connected vehicles, transportation agencies have access to continuously growing volumes of heterogeneous traffic data. However, traditional shallow machine learning models have limitations in fully exploiting large historical datasets and uncovering complex nonlinear spatiotemporal relationships [2]. Traffic flow exhibits stochastic, time-varying patterns affected by many factors like demand fluctuations, incidents, weather, and control measures [3]. This makes accurate modeling and prediction challenging.

Recent advances in deep learning provide new opportunities to overcome limitations of earlier approaches and improve predictive capabilities. Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance on myriad problems involving big, high-dimensional data in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting [4]. By learning hierarchical representations and mappings, deep networks can uncover latent patterns and dependencies beyond the reach of shallow learning techniques and statistical methods [5]. 

This paper reviews recent literature on deep learning techniques for short-term traffic flow prediction. The potential benefits and key architectures are discussed. Findings from studies are highlighted along with directions for future research. The review aims to summarize progress in this emerging area at the intersection of deep learning and intelligent transportation.

2. Deep Learning Models for Traffic Prediction

A range of deep neural network architectures have been investigated for traffic prediction. Major categories include deep belief networks, stacked autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Hybrid models combining recurrent, convolutional, and other specialized layers have also been proposed.

2.1 Deep Belief Networks

Deep belief networks (DBNs) are probabilistic generative models composed of multiple layers of latent variables [6]. DBNs can be pre-trained in an unsupervised manner by greedily stacking and training individual restricted Boltzmann machines. When trained on traffic data, DBNs can discover patterns and correlations in historical measurements from multiple sensor locations [7].

Huang et al. [7] developed a DBN model with a regression output layer for multi-step traffic flow forecasting. The DBN outperformed multivariate linear regression and backpropagation neural networks in predicting flows on a freeway network with varying missing data levels. DBNs have also been applied for travel time prediction [8] and traffic congestion detection [9]. A limitation is that DBNs do not directly model temporal dependencies.

2.2 Stacked Autoencoders 

Stacked autoencoders (SAEs) are neural networks formed by stacking layers of autoencoders that encode the input into a latent representation and decode it back to reconstruct the original input [10]. Each layer is greedily trained as an autoencoder individually. SAEs extract generic features and patterns from traffic data in an unsupervised manner before final supervised training.

Lv et al. [11] developed an SAE model with a logistic regression output layer for traffic flow prediction that outperformed support vector regression and shallow neural networks. SAEs have also been used for travel speed prediction [12] and taxi demand forecasting [13]. While SAEs learn spatial relationships, they do not inherently capture temporal dynamics. 

2.3 Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed to model sequential data by maintaining history through cyclic connections [14]. This enables capturing long-term temporal dependencies, ideal for traffic forecasting. RNN variants like long short-term memory (LSTM) address issues like exploding/vanishing gradients in training [15]. 

Ma et al. [16] applied LSTM networks to predict traffic speed and demonstrated they can memorize long-term traffic patterns. Wu et al. [17] combined CNN and LSTM modules for spatiotemporal modeling, outperforming other methods. RNNs are also useful for related tasks like travel time prediction [18]. A limitation is directly modeling complex spatial dependencies.

2.4 Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract localized spatial features via kernel filters and have proven very effective for grid-structured data [19]. For traffic prediction, the spatial topology and correlations can be exploited by CNNs. They have been applied for flow forecasting [20], demand prediction [21], and congestion detection [22]. Limitations include naively treating time as just another dimension.

Hybrid deep networks aim to combine strengths of CNNs and RNNs by using convolutional layers to extract spatial features and recurrent layers to capture temporal dynamics [17, 23]. Attention mechanisms can also help identify relevant inputs. Such deep hybrid models show promise for spatiotemporal traffic prediction.

3. Key Findings and Future Outlook

Studies have demonstrated significant improvements in prediction accuracy using deep over shallow learning. Deep networks can uncover latent traffic flow features and relationships that better generalize to new data. In [11], stacked autoencoders reduced error by over 15% compared to shallow neural networks. Hybrid models that leverage spatial and temporal modeling strengths of CNNs and RNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance [23].

However, deep networks are often criticized as black boxes. Important future work is on explainability methods to provide insights into their workings and bridge the gap between data-driven and traditional model-based traffic flow theory [24]. Interactive visualizations can help analysts understand and refine predictions [25].

Another direction is developing more efficient deep architectures that balance model complexity, training time, and generalization. Regularization methods and network pruning can help avoid overfitting on noisy traffic data [26]. Transfer learning can reduce training data requirements [27]. These can aid deployment for real-time operations.

Finally, integration with transportation infrastructure remains challenging. Prediction systems must be robust and adaptive as new data sources and traffic control measures emerge. Deep learning has made significant progress but fully realizing its promise requires translating accuracy gains to real-world impact.

4. Conclusion

This paper reviewed deep learning techniques for short-term traffic flow forecasting. State-of-the-art methodscombining strengths of recurrent, convolutional, and attention-based networks were highlighted. Studies demonstrate the vast potential to improve prediction accuracy by deep learning. Future opportunities include interpretable models, efficient architectures, and integration with transportation operations and planning. As deep learning advances and transportation evolves, this synergy between fields can enable smarter, more dynamic traffic systems.
